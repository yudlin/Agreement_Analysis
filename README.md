# Agreement_Analysis
Bland-Altman Agreement Analysis
        This program is used for the agreement evaluation between two methods
        and the test for repeatability.

        J. M. Bland and D. G. Altman, "Statistical methods for assessing
        agreement between two methods of clinical measurement", Lancet,
        1986,i, pp.307-310.

     Inputs:
         S1    Measured data, an (N1, ) array.
         S2    Ground truth data, an (N2, ) array, N2 = N1.
        Ana    1 = Agreement analysis (default),
               2 = Repeatability test.
       sFig    True = Show the figures, False = Do not show the figures
               (default = True).

     Output:
      d_bar    Mean of the bias (difference).
      coref    Pearson's correlation coefficient.
      UpLimit  Upper limit of agreement.
      LoLimit  Lower limit of agreement.

     Usage example: (assume you have S1 and S2)
        from agreement import agreement
        d_bar, coref, UpLimit, LoLimit = agreement(S1, S2, 1, True)
